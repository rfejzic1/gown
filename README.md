# Gown

Gown is an open framework for building web applications in go.
The goal is to make it easy to structure and generate parts of your application, but have
the freedom to change it to fit your needs. All the code is there in your repo for you to edit,
without any magic in the background or any runtime besides what's there in your repo.
